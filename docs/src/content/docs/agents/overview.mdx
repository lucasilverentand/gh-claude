## Building Your Own Agent

Every agent follows the same simple pattern:

1. **Define triggers** - When should the agent run?
2. **Declare permissions** - What can the agent access?
3. **Specify outputs** - What actions can the agent take?
4. **Write instructions** - Tell Claude what to do in natural language

```markdown
---
name: My Custom Agent
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  issues: write
outputs:
  add-comment: { max: 1 }
---

# My Custom Agent

```

See the [Agent Definition Guide](/guide/agent-definition) for complete documentation.
